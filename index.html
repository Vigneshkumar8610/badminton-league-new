        Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be
        played with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" (with one player per side) and
        "doubles" (with two players per side). Badminton is often played as a casual outdoor activity in a yard or
        on a beach; professional games are played on a rectangular indoor court. Points are scored by striking the
        shuttlecock with the racquet and landing it within the other team's half of the court, within the set
        boundaries.
        Each side may only strike the shuttlecock once before it passes over the net. Play ends once the shuttlecock
        has struck the floor or ground, or if a fault has been called by the umpire, service judge, or (in their
        absence) the opposing side.
